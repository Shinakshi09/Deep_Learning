## Note :

I have used the same dataset which I used for Botlzmann machine. Movie ratings datasets.

I created this architecture using PyTorch. It is simple model not very dense architecture. 

But have tried many dense and light weight architecture which will soon be added to PyTorch repo. you can check out the experiments performed there.'
