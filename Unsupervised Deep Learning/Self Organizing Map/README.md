## What is Self Organising Map (SOM)

A Self organising map is a clustering technique that helps you uncover categories in large dataset such as finding the customers profile based on the past purchase.

In SOM, Neurons are arranged in a single(1D), 2D grid which can take the shape of either rectangle or hexagons. 


Through the multiple iterations, neurons on grid will gradually coalesce around areas with high density of data points. 

In SOM, We have training data but we do not have labels in it. It learns from the data to form the cluster. There is no activation function in SOM. In SOM weights are categorised on the node itself
